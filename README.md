# Notesolvers

Project for all your notes troubles

This is a NodeJS(V18.15.0) and React(V18.2.0) application, designed to create, edit and delete simple notes.

It stores the data in an SQL database hosted in alwaysData.
## Installation

To setup the project for running, use the following commands:

```bash
  cd backend
  npm run setup
```
    
## ERD

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to fully implement the categories dynamic in the application, but the table was made for a future implementation.
